<strong>ABOUT</strong>
<br>
Moveen is a library for <strong>automatic animation</strong> - it adds common cinematic grade animations to any model.
<br>
<br>
With virtually no effort you get the whole range of common animations for your model - walk, strafe, jib, recoil, hit, ragdolled death.
Even more - all animations are calculated at runtime so model gets seamless transitions between states and natural reaction to the external influences. And its legs never slide again.
You just connect the bones of your rigged model, and it comes alive.
<br>
Note, $30 - is the beta price and will be higher when the library will be released. Beta customers will get release version without any additional cost.
<br>
<br>

<strong>Update (v0.7)</strong>:
Significant upgrade for stepping (run and jump animations now available), new motors conception, many prefabs for prototyping, few new models and many bugs fixed, and tunings made.
